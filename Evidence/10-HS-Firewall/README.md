# Hybrid Network Architecture & Centralized Firewall Routing Validation

## Executive Summary
This directory contains end-to-end evidence validating the deployment, asymmetric route remediation, and stateful security enforcement of a production-grade hybrid cloud landing zone. Rather than relying on direct VNet peering shortcuts, all cross-spoke and hybrid transit traffic is routed through a centralized Azure Firewall NVA, bridging on-premises Active Directory (`DC01`) to Azure spoke workloads over an encrypted IPsec Site-to-Site VPN.

## 3. Evidence Chain of Custody

| Step | Source System | Evidence File / Artifact | Key Findings |
|---|---|---|---|
| **1. Tunnel Binding** | `DC01` | [route-print](./route-print.txt) | Persistent routes for `10.1.0.0/16` and `10.2.0.0/16` bound to interface `26` (`169.254.0.26`) |
| **2. Gateway Transit** | `vm-testVNET` | [portal-vng-peering](./portal-vng-peering.jpg) | Gateway Transit enabled on peering toward Hub; `GatewaySubnet` UDR routes to Firewall |
| **3. Firewall Policy** | Azure Firewall | [azfw-rule-collection](./azfw-rule-collection.jpg) | `DefaultNetworkRuleCollectionGroup` configured with `RC-Active-Directory-Sync` (Priority `200`) |
| **4. Port Reachability** | Spoke 2 VM | [spoke2-nc-validation](./spoke2-nc-validation.jpg) | `nc -zv 10.0.2.4 <port>` returns open/connected across all required directory service ports |
| **5. Packet Inspection** | Log Analytics | [azfw-network-rule-log](./azfw-network-rule-log.jpg) | `AZFWNetworkRule` logs `Action: Allow` on rule `RC-Active-Directory-Sync` for transit flows |
| **6. Boundary Control & Policy Mutation** | Log Analytics | [azfw-ssh-deny-allow](./azfw-ssh-deny-allow.jpg) | Single query captures implicit `Deny` on unauthorized port 22 inbound from `DC01`, transitioning to `Allow` following the deployment of rule `Allow-OnPrem-SSH`. |
| **7. Centralized Egress Filtering** | `vm-test` / Log Analytics | [fqdn-application-filter](./fqdn-application-filter.jpg) | Outbound `curl` requests intercepted by `0.0.0.0/0` UDR; demonstrates explicit `Deny` on unmatched FQDNs (`reddit.com`, `facebook.com`, `x.com`) vs. stateful SNI pass-through on allowed domains (`google.com`) via `AZFWApplicationRule`. |

## 4. Deep-Dive Analysis: Routing & Security Mechanics

### Asymmetric Path Mitigation & Host Route Injection
To enable communication between the on-premises virtual environment and Azure spokes without dropping packets at the stateful firewall plane:
* **Host Routing:** The Windows host kernel requires explicit persistent routes (`route -p add`) mapping both `10.1.0.0/16` and `10.2.0.0/16` to the APIPA tunnel interface (`169.254.0.26`) to prevent packets from routing to the default gateway[cite: 1].
* **Gateway Subnet UDR:** A custom route table applied to `GatewaySubnet` forces all ingress cross-premises traffic destined for Spoke 2 (`10.2.0.0/16`) directly to the Azure Firewall (`10.3.1.4`) before reaching workload subnets.
* **Return Path Integrity:** Spoke subnets utilize a UDR routing `10.0.2.0/24` to the Azure Firewall private IP, ensuring both ingress and egress passes traverse the stateful engine symmetrically.

### Stateful Identity Traffic Inspection (`RC-Active-Directory-Sync`)
Instead of allowing uninspected network traversal, domain services are explicitly filtered and governed through stateful network rules:
* **Directory Services:** TCP/UDP `389` (LDAP), `636` (LDAPS), and `135` (RPC Endpoint Mapper).
* **Authentication & Names:** TCP/UDP `88` (Kerberos) and `53` (DNS).
* **File & Policy Transport:** TCP `445` (SMB).
* Azure Firewall maintains connection tracking tables, verifying bidirectional session state across the Hub boundary while logging every individual transit packet to Azure Log Analytics.

### Zero-Trust Boundary Enforcement & Policy Mutation (`azfw-ssh-deny-allow.jpg`)
To prove that Azure Firewall acts as an active security boundary rather than an uninspected transit bridge:
* **Implicit Zero-Trust Baseline:** Initial inbound SSH attempts (`TCP 22`) from `DC01` (`10.0.2.4`) to the Spoke 2 Linux host (`10.2.0.4`) hit the default network rule deny action, verifying that all non-whitelisted cross-premises traffic is dropped at the central hub inspection engine.
* **Deterministic Policy Mutation:** Deploying rule collection `RC-Management` with rule `Allow-OnPrem-SSH` (Priority `205`, TCP `22`, Source: `10.0.2.0/24`, Destination: `10.2.0.0/16`) instantly transitions connection attempts to `Action: Allow` without requiring session resets or changes to the underlying IPsec VPN tunnel configuration.

### Layer-7 Egress Inspection & Domain Filtering (`fqdn-application-filter.jpg`)
To secure outbound workload communications without granting open internet egress:
* **UDR-Enforced Egress Redirection:** Spoke 2 subnets route `0.0.0.0/0` directly to the Azure Firewall (`10.3.1.4`), forcing all outbound HTTP/HTTPS sessions into the Layer-7 inspection pipeline.
* **Granular FQDN Whitelisting:** Azure Firewall evaluates incoming web requests against authorized domain rules. Unapproved destinations (`reddit.com`, `facebook.com`, `x.com`) are dropped at the perimeter.
* **SNI-Based HTTPS Inspection:** For TLS/HTTPS connections, the firewall inspects the Server Name Indication (SNI) header in the TLS Client Hello to enforce domain whitelisting transparently before session payload encryption.
